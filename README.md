# Customer-Purchases-Prediction
Customer purchase prediction aims to predict customers' future purchases, and the prediction results are of great importance for conducting future commercial activities. To obtain accurate predictions of customer purchases, this paper develops a machine learning framework based on historical behavioural data. 

# Dataset Description 
dataset “customer_data.csv” contains 400 records
representing some of the company’s previous customers. The customer
data is composed of the customer’s age and salary. The final column (i.e.,
the target) is a boolean value (0 if the customer didn’t purchase a new car
and 1 if he/she purchased a new car).
